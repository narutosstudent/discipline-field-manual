Discipline is the root of all good qualities.

You can control yourself, whatever you want to do and accomplish, start HERE and NOW.

Rest when you've truly given every blood and sweat into the battle.

Risk over regret. If you do regret, learn and move on, now GO.

Not feeling it? Still, get it DONE!

Emotions are out of the window.

Be thankful every morning when waking up, live every day with purpose and passion.

Live today as if it is your last day, but also live today as if it you're going to live for another 5 years.

Don't stop, and never rely on motivation.

It is you versus you, become better than your past self, every day, take steps and never let yourself become weaker, only STRONGER.

Feeling overwhelmed is a sign you're on a good path, you're pushing yourself to the LIMITS.

Train, EVERY DAY!

There is one time no one can take away from you, pre-dawn, that's the time to workout, while others are sleeping, you're in war, grinding, fighting against yourself and becoming STRONGER as others are getting WEAKER.

Be up before the sun, ready to attack.

Be up at 4.30 every day, try to work out between 5 - 6 and still get over 2 hours of work before the fulltime job starts. You can take a nap around 12 a clock during the day.

Once the alarm clock goes of, GO, warrior mode, be hungry to embrace death with HONOR.

Don't use your phone when going to bed, it tricks the mind the it is day, and makes it harder for you to sleep. Put the alarm clock on and set the phone on charge somewhere, then close the light and go to bed, see it as war. Once the light shuts off, we get the necessary amount of sleep to wake up tomorrow before sun, to rise and go into battle again, there is no fucking around after the light is off, it is time for war, and it is time to DIE.

Fasting is good.

Eat whole foods and stay AWAY FROM SUGAR, even a FRACTION.

Do 24 hour fast regularly, ideally once a week.

If you're sick or injured, do what you can, and don't LAY IN BED ALL DAY.
